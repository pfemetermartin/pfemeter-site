# Clear decisions require clear foundations.

I support public and private clients throughout **all project phases** – from concept development, planning, variant studies, authority procedures, RuI schedules, tender documents and awarding, right through to execution and handover into operation. Thanks to my long-standing experience on both sides – as client and as planner – I know the technical, organizational, and economic requirements inside out, as well as the practical workflows on construction sites. Whether standards, project manuals, budget planning, cost tracking, or controlling: I ensure clear structures, efficient communication, and minimal friction losses among all stakeholders.

## My project experience includes:
- Mechanical and plant engineering  
- Infrastructure and hydraulic engineering  
- Concrete structures (incl. white tank / waterproof concrete)

I have managed projects both as project manager and as site supervisor (ÖBA) and understand the interfaces between planning, execution, and operation from hands-on practice.  

**My focus:** Efficient communication, structured decision-making, and minimization of friction between project partners. I use BIM exactly where it adds real value – pragmatically, not dogmatically.
