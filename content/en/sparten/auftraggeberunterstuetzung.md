Clear decisions require clear foundations.

I support public and private clients throughout all project phases – from concept development through planning and tendering to execution.  
Thanks to my experience on **both sides** – as client and as planner – I know the technical, organisational and economic requirements as well as the practical processes on site.

## My project experience covers:
- Mechanical and plant engineering  
- Infrastructure and hydraulic engineering  
- Concrete structures (including white tank construction)  

I have managed projects both as **project manager** and as **site supervisor (ÖBA)** and understand the interfaces between planning, execution and operation from first-hand experience.

My focus: **efficient communication**, structured decision-making and minimisation of friction between project partners.  
I use **BIM pragmatically** – exactly where it adds real value, never dogmatically.

## Core services
- Project management and deputy project management  
- Preparation of bills of quantities and tender documents (planning and construction services, including BIM/AIA references)  
- Support with tendering procedures and contract management  
- Project structuring, cost tracking and controlling  
- Preparation of decision-making documents for internal and external approvals  
- Support for project teams during transition phases (e.g. change of project manager or planner)
