From concept to form – precise, versatile, combinable.

I create highly detailed 3D solid models for technical, structural and plant-specific applications – exactly to the level of detail your project requires.

## Source materials include:
- Sketches and descriptions  
- Point clouds  
- 2D drawings  
- Your ideas discussed at the table – I help turn thoughts into digital form  

## Further processing & integration:
- Integration into BIM workflows and 3D terrain models  
- 2D derivations with dimensions and manufacturing-relevant information  
- Generation of bills of quantities  
- Visualisations for planning, execution and communication  

This results in consistent models that combine technical precision with spatial, topographical and structural information.

## Core services
- 3D modelling of components, assemblies and plants  
- Visualisation of technical systems and components  
- Combination of solid and surface models within BIM workflows  
- Derivation of 2D drawings and manufacturing documentation  
- Integration into bills of quantities and planning processes  
- Processing of point clouds, sketches and legacy data  

## Software
I currently work primarily with **AutoCAD**.  
**Blender** is also used for format conversion and certain modelling steps.  

My experience further includes:  
**Autodesk Plant 3D**, **Revit**, **PTC Pro/ENGINEER**, **CATIA V5** (and to a small extent V4), and **Siemens NX**.  

Upon request, work can also be carried out in these systems or their current versions (**Creo Parametric**, **CATIA V6/3DEXPERIENCE**, **Siemens NX Series**).  
Extensive experience with **Blender** is also available.
