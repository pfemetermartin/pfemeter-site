Terrain, pipelines, structures – visualised before they exist.

I create and edit **3D surface models** for infrastructure, water and civil engineering projects. From terrain models and pipe networks to complex river and reservoir systems – these models form the basis for option studies, quantity take-offs, BIM workflows and visualisations.

## My services include:
- 3D surface models (surfaces) for terrain, alignments and structures  
- Integration with and into 3D solid models  
- Network-based pipeline models  
- 2D derivations with dimensions, cross-sections and longitudinal profiles  
- Quantity surveying and billing-relevant evaluations  

My background in hydraulic engineering, concrete construction, civil engineering, pipeline construction and municipal infrastructure planning enables precise, practice-oriented implementation – even with large data volumes and heterogeneous planning environments.

**BIM in earthworks**: I actively integrate civil engineering projects into BIM structures. Solutions are evolving rapidly – and already today BIM elements can be used meaningfully and efficiently in earthworks.

## Core services
- Creation and editing of 3D terrain and surface models  
- Option studies, volume calculations, quantity take-offs and billing  
- Integration of surface, solid and BIM models  
- Generation of cross-sections, longitudinal sections and planning documents  
- Processing of legacy and survey data (point clouds, DTMs)  
- Integration of earthworks and civil engineering projects into BIM structures  

## Software
I currently work primarily with **AutoCAD Civil 3D**.  
My experience also includes:  
**Aquaveo SMS** (Surface-water Modeling System), **BricsCAD**, **ArcGIS**, **QGIS**, **Global Mapper**, and photogrammetry software such as **Agisoft Metashape**.  

Upon request, projects can also be processed in these systems or their current versions (**ArcGIS Pro**, **BricsCAD Civil**, **Global Mapper Pro**, **Agisoft Metashape Professional**).
