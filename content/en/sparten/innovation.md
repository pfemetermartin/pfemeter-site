Thanks to my cross-disciplinary technical knowledge and personal passion for **innovation, research, artificial intelligence, programming, philosophy, architecture, art and culture**, I am particularly drawn to projects that – at first glance – do **not** fit into my classic field of work.

I am fascinated by **interfaces** – between technology and thinking, practice and theory, human and machine. Topics from physics and natural sciences shape the way I see complex relationships.

My work with people benefits from many years of focus on **communication and personal development**. I have learned that technical solutions only work when you truly understand the people behind them.  
This combination of **technical precision and human clarity** enables me to make projects successful not only technically, but also on a human level.

I love bringing an **unconventional, often clarifying perspective** to unusual challenges.  
**Contact me** – in the worst case we have an inspiring conversation, in the best case something completely new emerges.

## Core focus
- Interdisciplinary concept development and idea generation  
- Integration of AI and data-driven approaches into planning processes  
- Research and experimental methods at the interface of technology and culture  
- Creative solutions for unconventional challenges  
- Collaborations between technology, science and art
