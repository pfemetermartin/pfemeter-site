I model pipeline networks in 3D – from compact plant piping to complex supply infrastructures.

## Pipelines are modelled according to requirements as:
- Solid elements** for detailed building services piping  
- Network-based** in combination with 3D terrain models (DTM) for buried pipelines  

The transition between both variants often occurs at building interfaces – for example, where the internal piping of a pumping station connects to the buried supply network.

## The models enable:
- Clear spatial representation of routes, fittings and connections  
- Coordination and clash detection  
- Reliable quantity take-off  
- Early detection of planning errors and interface issues  

My experience in pipeline construction includes both internal piping of pumping stations and transport/supply lines in the drinking water sector – with materials ranging from stainless steel and ductile cast iron (SGZ) to PE. Connecting to existing pipelines with challenging materials, as well as route finding in urban environments, are among my familiar fields of work.

## Core services
- 3D modelling of pipeline and supply systems  
- Integration of building and external network models  
- Route planning and clash detection in complex planning environments  
- Quantity surveying and documentation  
- Integration of pipeline networks into BIM and DTM models  
- Processing of legacy data and pipeline inventories  

## Software
I currently work with **AutoCAD Civil 3D** and **AutoCAD**.  
My experience also includes modelling in **Autodesk Plant 3D** and **CE-Pipe**.  
Upon request, projects can be processed in other systems such as **Bentley OpenFlows / WaterGEMS**, **EPANET**, **InfraWorks**, **Revit MEP**, **Autodesk Navisworks**, or **Trimble Business Center** – depending on project requirements and data environment.
