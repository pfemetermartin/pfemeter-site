## DI Martin Pfemeter

I am the founder of Zeichenbüro & Beratung e.U.

My professional journey has taken me from mechanical engineering design through academic research at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU) to planning, project management and construction supervision in the fields of water, infrastructure and plant engineering.

This versatility still shapes my work today – technical precision, understanding of processes and the ability to clearly structure complex relationships.

I have worked on both the planner and the client side and therefore know the different perspectives within a project – from the initial idea to final implementation.  
I see consulting as a bridge between disciplines, people and interests.

Privately I am a father of three children and, after various professional positions in Lower Austria and Styria, now live in Vienna.  
I grew up in Wildalpen, a region where water, landscape and technology interact directly – the connection between nature and engineering has accompanied me since childhood.
